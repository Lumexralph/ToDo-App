# ToDo-App

Getting back my Javascript mojo back with TypeScript by building this popular app version using a Procedural, Object-oriented and functional programming approach.

## Versions of the app

* v1 - Procedural programming with little functional programming

* v2 - Object-oriented programming, with immutability of data, SOLID principles, functional programming, and MVC pattern.

## Getting Started

Clone the app

    git clone https://github.com/Lumexralph/ToDo-App.git

Change into the created directory and into v1 or v2, whichever version you want

    cd ToDo-App/{preferred directory - v1 or v2}

Install all the required libraries

    npm install

Startup the app and you should be automatically directed to the app in the browser... Have fun with it!

    npm run serve
